# Mobile

The mobile app is built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) using the [Expo](https://expo.dev/) toolkit.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the Expo development server:

```bash
npm install
npx expo start
```

This will launch Expo in development mode so you can run the app on Android, iOS or the web.
