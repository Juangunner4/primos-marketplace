# Future State

This document previously outlined the tasks required to bring Primos Marketplace to a production ready release. The major items have now been addressed and the notes are kept here for posterity.

## Completed Items

- **Complete Test Coverage** – backend and frontend tests now run in CI and cover critical functionality.
- **Security Review** – API endpoints were audited and CORS settings validated.
- **CI/CD Pipeline** – automated Docker builds deploy to Render and Vercel with secrets managed via environment variables.
- **Monitoring** – logging has been expanded and Sentry integrated for error reporting.
- **Data Backups** – automated MongoDB backups are configured for production.

## Preparing for Production

1. Populate `frontend/.env.production` with all required keys including the MongoDB connection string and Solana RPC endpoints.
2. Create the environment group in Render and upload the variables from `.env.production`.
3. Connect this repository to Render so that pushes to `main` trigger a new container build.
4. Deploy the frontend from the `frontend` directory to Vercel using its own repository or by exporting the build artifacts from Render.
5. Run `mvn package` in the backend and `npm run build` in the frontend to verify that production builds succeed.

With these tasks complete the project has entered full production.
